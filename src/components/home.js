        The Math Magician brings convenience and efficiency to the world of
        calculation. It calculates answers to full accuracy, and is designed to
        compute very large numbers. The app would be more useful in fields such
        as cosmology, astronomy, mathematics, cryptography, and statistical
        mechanics where big number calculations are required. Acceptable formats
        are integers and decimals. Percentage which represents the ratio of a
        fraction in 100 can also be calculated. Math Magician is 100% free.
